This is an prework application for calculating the tip for a bill amount.
Time spent: 10 hours spent in total

Completed user stories:
 1. Required: User can input a bill amount with optional two decimal places, and instantly see tip, total amounts
 2. Required: User can vary the tip amount using segmented control, and update the total instantly
 3. Optional: Instead of the fixed tip % (story #2), user can slide a scale (for service) to update tip and total

Notes:
Tried to make the slider move too, according to segmented control chosen (and vice versa). Didn't work. Will be emailing for help.
